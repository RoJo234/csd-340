        <h2>Dan Carter</h2>
        <p class="about-text">
            Dan grew up in the 90s in a middle-class household in the suburbs outside of Pittsburg. He had the average childhood you might expect except for his unwavering curiosity. Dan needed to know how things worked,   

            whether he was taking apart his game consoles or working on cars with his dad, a mechanic.<br><br> In the early 2000s Dan would build his first computer, which sparked his desire to eventually pursue computer science.  

            When he wasn't busy with his schoolwork or over at a friend's house, he would play the Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG) World of Warcraft (WoW). It was unlike any game he had played before with   

            thousands of players all in a single massive world. After playing for a while, he discovered that there was a feature in the game that allowed users to create client mods called addons. Dan, being the curios fellow that he is,  

            had to know how to make them. Addons for WoW are coded in the Lua scripting language, so this is where his coding journey began. He made addons that he found useful until he eventually made an addon to play poker with his   

            friends to gamble in game currency, which eventually led to his account getting banned.<br><br> After his Junor year of high school he qualified for a summer trip to Spain due to his good grades in his Spanish classes. During this trip is 
            
            when he discovered his love for travel. Since returning from this trip, he has traveled to many different countries and states, he loves learning about different cultures and trying their food. During college Dan studied Computer Science at
            
            the Illinois Institute of Technology and found new games to play in his free time after moving on from WoW. After graduating Dan moved to Arizona where he is currently employed as a Software Developer at Amazon.
